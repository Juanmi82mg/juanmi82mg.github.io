[UMA - Industrial Engineering Building -](https://oas.sci.uma.es:8443/ht/2016/ProgramasAsignaturas_Titulacion_5046_AsigUMA_52653.pdf)  ANÁLISIS VECTORIAL Y ESTADÍSTICA (in Spanish): Group activities

This BSc. course is divided into three blocks. The first one comprises concepts and methods from differential geometry and its applications to parameterized curves and surfaces. The second block deals with vector calculus, including line, multiple and surface integrals and related theorems. The third block consists of an introductory course to statistics (descriptive statistics, probability theory, random variables, hypothesis testing, etc.)
